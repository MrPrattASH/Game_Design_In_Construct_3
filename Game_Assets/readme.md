# Creative Commons Game Assets
Below are links to various creative commons game assets. Each asset library will tell you which kind of Creative Commons (CC) license the asset is under. 

## What is the Creative Commons?
Taken from [CreativeCommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/faq/#what-is-creative-commons-and-what-do-you-do) 
> Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized terms; those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. Our vision is to help others realize the full potential of the internet. CC has affiliates all over the world who help ensure our licenses work internationally and who raise awareness of our work.

CC provides a large variety of licenses, and each license tells you what you can and cannot use that product or asset for. You can see all licenses in brief [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) **and it is expected that you read through the license overview carefully** as you will need to provide correct attribution to game assets you have used for your games. 

With that said, here are a few different game asset resources for you to use. 

## [Kenny.nl](https://kenney.nl/)
A fantastic site with lots of 2D, 3D, isometric, and character sprite assets. Also made here at home in the Netherlands! All content is free, though donations for "asset packs" are of course accepted, though not required. Many assets can be combined using the tile map system object, or taken as individual sprites with the ability for various animation frames to be uploaded. 

#### Licensing
