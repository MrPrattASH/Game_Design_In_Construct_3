1. Head over to [editor.construct.net](https://editor.construct.net). Bookmark this page, as you'll use this page for every game. 

2. Complete the built in tour and make a pig & apple eating game like the above gif.  While completing the tour, be sure to *read all pop up messages*. These explain why you're adding conditions, events, and behaviours to your game. If you skip these, you will miss fundamental understandings about how the game engine works.
