### Create a Github Account
1. Head over to [github.com](www.github.com) and create a GitHub account using "Sign up". Notes:
* If you already have a personal Github account, skip this step. 
* Be sure to use your ASH google account. 
* This is a *public website*. Do not use your real name in your username
* This can easily become a future portfolio piece where you share your code with future employers/schools. Keep your username semi-professional.

### Download GitHub Desktop
1. Head over to [this site](https://desktop.github.com/) and download the GitHub Desktop App. Be sure you are downloading the MacOS version, **not** the windows version. (your file will be a .zip file, not a .exe file)

2. Once you have this file downloaded, you need to unzip it (simple open the file, and you'll see a new program showup in your downloads). 

However, simply opening a zip file is not equivalent to installing the program correctly. To install, we have to add this to *your personal applications folder*. 
* Your computer has 2 different applications folder. 
1. Your main root folder. This is managed by ASH, and where all your school applications are. you don't have access to installing things here. 
2. Your *personal* applications folder. You are able to install programs here. 

With a finder window selected, in your menu bar (top of your screen, not finder window), select "Go > Home"

3. With your finder window still open, go to your Applications Folder.

4. Unzip your downloaded program file if you haven't done so yet. Then, Drag and drop the GitHub Desktop App into this personal applications folder. *Github desktop will not function properly if you open the program from downloads, desktop, etc.* 

5. After installing, open GitHub Desktop, and sign in to your GitHub account. Your GitHub desktop is now setup!
